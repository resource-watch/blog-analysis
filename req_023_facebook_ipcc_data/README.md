# Climate Scope
Additionally data from Bloomberg NEF's Global Climate Scope 2021 is available in the folder [Climate_Scope](https://github.com/resource-watch/blog-analysis/tree/master/req_023_facebook_ipcc_data/Climate_Scope). 

Climatescope is a unique market assessment, interactive report and index that evaluates the conditions for energy transition investment globally and evaluates their ability to attract capital for low-carbon technologies while building a greener economy. It also provides a snapshot of where clean energy policy and finance stand today and a guide to what can happen in the future. This year, BNEF gathered detailed information on 136 markets globally, or 107 emerging markets and 29 developed nations. Climatescope 2021 also expanded from a power focus, to a wider energy transition scope, including power, transport and buildings. 

The Climatescope 2021 methodology includes 163 indicators and sub-indicators split among three sectors and into three key topic areas that encompass each market’s previous accomplishments, current investment environment, and future opportunities for clean energy growth. Three sectors – power, transport and buildings – are scored across three main parameters:

1. Fundamentals. This parameter encompasses a market’s key policies, market structures and barriers to investment of deployment. This includes the fundamental structures that can help renewable power, clean transport and clean technologies for heating flourish.
2. Opportunities. This parameter examines a market’s potential to grow its supply of renewable power, clean transport and clean technologies for heating. Markets with certain prices or other conditions offer the best opportunities for clean growth.
3. Experience. This parameter takes into account a market’s achievements to date across the three sectors. Markets with greater experience deploying renewable power capacity typically offer lower risks, lower technology costs and lower costs of capital for developers. This parameter includes historical deployment of clean technologies surveyed and growth rates of investment into the sectors.

It is important to note that several key indicators that contribute to the above parameters are “levelized” against a market’s gross domestic product, population, installed capacity and generation. The methodology seeks to take into account and then discount the fact that some markets attract larger volumes of capital simply because they are bigger.

The overall Climate Scope 2021 score is available in the folder [Climate_Scope](https://github.com/resource-watch/blog-analysis/tree/master/req_023_facebook_ipcc_data/Climate_Scope. The scores were calculated based on three topics with their associated weights in parentheses: fundamentals (50%), opportunities (25%), and experience (25%). THe Climate Scope 2021 score is out of five. Additional data on each country is available in their [larger Excel spreadsheet](https://global-climatescope.org/CS2021_Model.xlsm), which requires enabling macros.
